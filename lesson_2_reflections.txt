What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Running git init will create the .git folder and be ready to accept files into the repository
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is the place that indicates new addition/deletion of files for the next commit.
	The working directory may contain files that are either part of the repository (under version control) or no added yet.
