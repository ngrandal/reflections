What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Running git init will create the .git folder and be ready to accept files into the repository
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is the place that indicates new addition/deletion of files for the next commit.
	The working directory may contain files that are either part of the repository (under version control) or no added yet.
	Value: ?
	
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Just add to staging area only those files that are involved in the logical change.
	The working directory may contain other dirty files, but only the ones on the staging area will be part of a future commit.
		
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Don't quite get this one. The best organization for history would be linear, so I can't imagine branches helping.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	A picture is worth a thousand words
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	Include the functionality of both branches into a single commit. 
	The new commit has two parents (each brach acts as one parent)
