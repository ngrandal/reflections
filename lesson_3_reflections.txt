When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Collaboration is the main reason for using a remote repository
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We want our local repository to be in a predictable state with everything commited before we update it with changes on remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are special clones that can only be created on GitHub. A clone is just a copy of a repository and a branch is a label within a repository.
	Use forks when not allowed to contribute to a repository directly. Use clone when allowed. 
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Be able to detect conflicts. Need to know if we can simply commit our changes or if we need to merge them with the remote
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Would need some other version control software and probably have remote access to the network where it resides.
